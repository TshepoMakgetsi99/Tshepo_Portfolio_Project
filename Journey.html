      <div class="col-12 text-center Lorem" style="font-weight: 100; color: white;">ADA, named after Ada Lovelace (the first female coder), is a non-profit programme which aims to educate young women of colour to become Front-End Developers and join the tech industry. ADA provides an immersive, mentored, fully-funded web development education to young, African, women.

        ADA's mission is to empower. They give young, African women the tools and confidence to become successful game-changers in the field of technology by providing them with immersive, mentored, fully-funded Front-End Development education.</div>

        <div class="w-100"></div>
        <div class="col-12 text-center Lorem" style="font-weight: 100; color: white;">The African Developers Academy had limited capacity in its first ever year, and so had to be rigorous in their testing and eventual selection of the student body of 2019/2020. This meant that students had to apply first through Harambe, where they completed a series of aptitude tests to make sure that they had what it takes to be a web developer.

          There were 500 applications, 100 selected candidates through Harambe and only 12 spots. This means that only 2% of applicants would make it through.
          
          All of the 100 selected candidates were invited to take part in challenges hosted by ADA which put them to the test - checking for resilience, strength of character, attitude and of course ability. The women who made it through proved themselves in many ways, and continued to do so throughout their studies. </div>

        <div class="w-100"></div>
        <div class="col-12 text-center Lorem" style="font-weight: 100; color: white;"><p style="color: white;font-weight: 100;">The selection process started at Harambee. We wrote a couple of tests before we were asked to come in for extensive testing. Here we were told to build our very own game, present it to a group of 50 people and participate in the games of others. Those who qualified were called in for a 3 day bootcamp, this is where I learned to code on Turtle Academy as a way of testing my coding aptitude. On the third day we were asked to make a unique drawing using turtle academy’s algorithms and to present it. I did just that, combining all the skills I learned from day one at harambee, the game day and bootcamp! 
        </p>
        <p style="color: white;font-weight: 100;">
          I started ADA with zero coding experience. I knew nothing about front end web development. At first, I was really stunned by what I was
           being taught and how quickly I grasped the teachings. Although it wasn't always easy, it was the best decision I ever made to be part of the tech industry because the love I have for coding is out of this world. The first language I learnt was HTML 5 and the environment we used to learn coding is Visual StudioCode.Thereafter, I learnt CSS and Javascript respectively, and in no time I was creating websites using Bootstrap4 and using Git and Github to manage my version control and host my websites. Although I am not yet too confident about Javascript but the basics I have managed to master them.
          </p>

          <p style="color: white;font-weight: 100;">I also make it a point that I do more of the exercises on Code Academy and Free Code Camp so that I at least master it. I still want to learn more coding languages. Some of the things I learnt throughout the program was to wireframe using inkscape and it made things so easy. The nicest thing learnt was how we tracked progress and I still use it even today is the Agile system using Kanban boards preferably on Trell, it helps me know what am supposed to do, how an time framing everything to work effectively.</p>
